Different classification ML model was created.

For this analysis we use different python libraries such as:
pandas, numpy, seaborn, sklearn.metrics, matplotlib, scipy.

The fiscal year 2019 and fiscal year 2018 dataset are each about 2 GB(~6.5 million rows)

This analysis was performed in Jupyter lab notebook. In these datasets following columns were present:
Date, start, visitior/neutral, visitot points, Home/neutral, Home points, Box score, OT, atttendance and notes.
